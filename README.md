# VolleyVision AI - Volleyball Analytics Dashboard

A web-based volleyball analytics platform I built to help coaches and players understand performance metrics through interactive visualizations and predictive modeling. This started as a personal project to explore how machine learning concepts could be applied to sports analytics.

**Live Demo**: https://shreeya1-pixel.github.io/VolleyVision/index.html


## About ME 

This project was personally inspired by my extensive volleyball background. I have been playing volleyball since 6th grade and have competed at various levels including:

- **National Level Volleyball Player** - Captain of national level teams
- **IPSC (Inter Public School Championship)** - Represented school in competitive tournaments
- **Inter University Competitions** - University level volleyball competitions
- **BSF (UAE's Largest Sports Festival)** - Competed in the biggest sports festivals in the UAE

My deep understanding of volleyball dynamics, player performance metrics, and the need for data-driven insights in sports analytics motivated me to create this machine learning platform. This project combines my passion for volleyball with my expertise in machine learning to provide meaningful performance analysis and predictions.

## What This Does

### Core Features
- **Input Player Stats**: Enter match data like spikes, blocks, serves, digs, and errors
- **Instant Analytics**: Get real-time performance breakdowns and efficiency scores
- **Predictive Modeling**: See forecasts for future match performance
- **Player Comparison**: Compare your stats with similar players in the database
- **Team Analysis**: Add multiple players to see team rankings and comparisons

### Technical Features
- **Time-Series Forecasting**: Predicts future performance based on historical patterns
- **Player Similarity Search**: Uses cosine similarity to find players with similar skill sets
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies exceptional performances with SHAP-like explanations
- **Radar Charts**: Visualize player skills across 6 different dimensions

## How It Works

### Performance Input
You can either manually enter your volleyball match statistics or use the autofill feature to see how the system works with sample data. The form captures:
- Spikes (offensive attacks)
- Blocks (defensive blocks)
- Serves (service attempts)
- Digs (defensive receptions)
- Errors (mistakes)
- Sets (setting actions)

### Efficiency Calculation
The system uses a weighted algorithm that considers:
- Positive actions (spikes, blocks, serves, digs, sets) with different weights
- Negative actions (errors) that reduce the score
- Overall efficiency as a percentage

### Advanced Analytics
- **Forecasting**: Uses historical data patterns to predict future performance
- **Similarity Search**: Compares your skills with a database of players
- **Anomaly Detection**: Flags exceptional performances and explains why they're notable

## Technology Stack

I built this using:
- **HTML5/CSS3**: For structure and styling
- **JavaScript**: For all the logic and interactions
- **Chart.js**: For data visualizations
- **No Backend**: Everything runs in the browser for simplicity

## Getting Started

1. **Download the files** or clone the repository
2. **Open index.html** in any modern web browser
3. **Enter your stats** or click "Autofill Sample" to see it in action
4. **Explore the different tabs** to see various analytics features

## Usage

### Basic Analytics
1. Enter your match statistics
2. Click "Generate ML Analytics"
3. View your efficiency score and performance breakdown
4. Check the radar chart to see your skill distribution

### Team Comparison
1. Scroll down to the "Team Comparison" section
2. Click "Add Player" to add other players' data
3. Fill in their stats and click "Analyze Team"
4. See rankings and comparison charts

### Advanced Features
- **ML Analytics Tab**: Time-series forecasting and anomaly detection
- **AI Predictions Tab**: Performance forecasting with confidence intervals
- **Player Similarity Tab**: Compare your skills with similar players

## Development Notes

This project started as an exploration of how to apply machine learning concepts to sports analytics without requiring a complex backend. I wanted to see if I could create meaningful insights using only frontend technologies.

The algorithms I implemented include:
- **Cosine Similarity**: For finding similar players based on skill vectors
- **Time-Series Analysis**: For performance forecasting
- **Statistical Anomaly Detection**: For identifying exceptional performances
- **Weighted Scoring**: For calculating efficiency metrics

## Future Ideas

Some features I'm considering adding:
- Export functionality for reports
- More sophisticated ML models
- Historical data tracking
- Team strategy recommendations
- Mobile app version

## Why I Built This

I’ve been playing volleyball since the 6th grade — it’s been a massive part of my life. I captained the national-level volleyball team for Delhi, represented in IPSC tournaments, and trained under coaches who always emphasized performance tracking.
But the truth is, even at elite levels, we never really had access to good analytical tools. Our coaches often said, “I wish we had something to help us see patterns, like what’s working, who’s dropping, what the numbers say.” That stuck with me.

So when I got into AI/ML, I knew I wanted to build something that wasn't just a technical demo, but something real — a platform that could actually help coaches and players understand the game better through data. This project is my attempt at bridging those two worlds: the athlete and the engineer in me.

## Technical Challenges

The biggest challenges were:
- Implementing ML algorithms in pure JavaScript
- Creating meaningful visualizations without external libraries
- Making the interface intuitive for non-technical users
- Ensuring real-time performance with complex calculations

## Learning Outcomes

This project taught me a lot about:
- Implementing mathematical algorithms in JavaScript
- Creating responsive data visualizations
- Building intuitive user interfaces
- Balancing complexity with usability
